# Circular and Dummy Linked List Implementation  

This project demonstrates the implementation of two advanced linked list types: **Circular Linked Lists** and **Dummy Node Linked Lists**. These structures extend the capabilities of traditional linked lists and are designed for specialized use cases where enhanced traversal or simplified operations are needed.  

## Features  

### Circular Linked List  
- **Circular Structure:** The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.  
- **Key Operations:**  
  - Add nodes to the list (at the beginning, middle, or end).  
  - Traverse nodes in a circular manner.  
  - Delete nodes while maintaining the circular structure.  
  - Efficient handling of edge cases, such as single-node lists.  

### Dummy Node Linked List  
- **Dummy Node:** A placeholder node at the start of the list simplifies operations like insertion and deletion.  
- **Key Operations:**  
  - Add and delete nodes without the need for special edge-case handling.  
  - Traverse and display the list.  
  - Maintain a consistent starting point for all operations.  

## Purpose  

This project showcases:  
- The versatility of **circular linked lists** for applications like buffering, scheduling, and gaming.  
- The simplicity and robustness introduced by **dummy nodes** in list operations.  
- Dynamic memory management and pointer manipulation in complex linked list scenarios.  

## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/circular-dummy-lists.git  
   cd circular-dummy-lists
