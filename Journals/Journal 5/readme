# Lab 5: Advanced Data Structures  

This project is part of **Lab 5**, focusing on the implementation and manipulation of advanced data structures, specifically **circular linked lists** and **dummy node linked lists**.  

## Objective  

The goal of this lab is to:  
- Deepen the understanding of linked lists by implementing specialized structures.  
- Explore practical use cases for circular linked lists and dummy nodes.  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills by handling edge cases in list operations.  

## Features  

### Circular Linked List  
- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - Nodes form a loop, with the last node pointing back to the first.  
  - Useful for problems like round-robin scheduling or continuous traversal.  
- **Implemented Operations:**  
  - Add, delete, and traverse nodes.  
  - Maintain the circular structure during modifications.  

### Dummy Node Linked List  
- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - Includes a dummy node at the start, simplifying edge cases.  
  - Improves code readability and reduces error-prone conditions.  
- **Implemented Operations:**  
  - Add and delete nodes seamlessly.  
  - Traverse and display the list.  

## Lab Instructions  

1. Implement both **circular linked lists** and **dummy node linked lists** in C++.  
2. Test the code with various inputs to ensure robustness.  
3. Document the code using meaningful variable names and comments.  

## How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lab-5-advanced-lists.git  
   cd lab-5-advanced-lists
