# Node and List Implementation  

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of **nodes** and **linked lists**. It serves as a practical application of data structure knowledge, showcasing how nodes can be used to build and manipulate lists dynamically.  

## Features  

- **Node Structure:** Each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node.  
- **Linked List Operations:**  
  - Add nodes to the list (at the beginning, middle, or end).  
  - Traverse and display the list.  
  - Insert nodes after specific values.  
  - Delete nodes.  
  - Handle special cases (e.g., empty lists or non-existent values).  
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** Efficient allocation and deallocation of memory for nodes.  

## Purpose  

This project was built to solidify the understanding of:  
- How linked lists are constructed and manipulated.  
- The relationship between nodes and pointers/references.  
- Implementation of basic and advanced linked list operations.  

## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-list-implementation.git  
   cd node-list-implementation
